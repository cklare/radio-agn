# radio-agn
Scripts used in to-be-submitted paper on increasing compact radio emission in AGN
These are the scripts I wrote for searching for increasing compact emission in AGN with the VAST survey. This repository is mostly for documentation/clarity of my methods purposes.

File structure - vast-agn-xmatch.py : takes a catalog of agn (coordinates + identifier) and crossmatches with the VAST survey data (which is proprietary)
